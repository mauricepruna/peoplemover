Pinecrest People Mover Web and Mobile Tracker

The Pinecrest People Mover is a free transit bus service operated by the Village of Pinecrest connecting our neighborhoods and schools. It is mostly used by middle and high school students who do not qualify for bus service from the school district. We would like to design a Web tracker and a Mobile tracker to show residents routes, hours of operation, real-time trolley location (as a list and as an interactive map) and allow for automatic notifications for arrival at userâ€™s favorite stops. The mobile tracker should work well on iPhone & android devices.
